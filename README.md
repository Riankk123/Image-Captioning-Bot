# Image-Captioning-Bot
## Dataset
I have used the Flickr8k Dataset which is available on Kaggle . It consists of 8k images with 5 captions for each image
## Model 
1.The model takes two inputs one in the form of images and another in the form of word embeddings . 
2.The Images were converted into vectors using the Pre-Trained Resnet and then used along with word embeddings to generate Captions 
3.The model uses LSTM and Pre-Trained Glove Word Embeddings during training and testing .
## Future Scope
This project can be used as a base for more complex projects like :
1.Aid to the blind people by using a camera to detect scenes in front of them.
2.Automatic Captioning can help, make Google Image Search as good as Google Search, as then every image could be first converted into a caption and then search can be performed based on the caption.
